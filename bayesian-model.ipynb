    "# Motivation\n",
    "We use bayesian analysis to have a better prediction with small set of data. That being said, IBNR Data is one of the case where bayesian analysis works better. But with a better result, there must also a price to be paid. That is expert's input. The main point of bayesian analysis is to choose prior distributions and it is not an easy task. But again, since this is a learning repository, we will learn together :D"
